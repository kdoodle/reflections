How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it makes it easier to see where the file has changed


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

If you need to go back to a different version it makes it simple to do
that

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Cons for Git:  if commits are done only on request, then you might miss saving a
midpoint change in information
Cons for googld docs:  it might take more time to figure out which change is
the problem
Pro for Google docs: you would definitely be able to go to a specific point in
time

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

git:  if all files involved in a change are committed together then it's more
properly organized 
google:  don't miss any changes

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log:  shows the commits you've done
git diff:  shows differences in file versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

You can always go back.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
