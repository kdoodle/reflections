What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a .git file to initialize for future commits.  It makes it possible
to start executing git commands on the new repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is where files that will be committed to the repository are kept
until you are ready to commit them.  It is kind of a failsafe method to
organize your decisions to update the repository.
